  <h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"
     title="wiki css" target="_blank"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>
     is a style sheet language
     used for describing the presentation of a document written in
     a markup language like HTML.[1]</p> <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology
     of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
     <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
     including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]</p>
     <img src="css.jpg" width="100%">
     <p>This separation can improve
     content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control
     in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
     pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
     css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
     <br>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible
     to present the same markup page in different styles for different
     rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print,
     by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
    for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
    <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme
    to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches
    a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
